        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; background-color: #efefef">Who am I?</h1>
        <p><strong>My name is Kenan Alnakoula. I'm a first year student at the High school of Amsterdam. I'm currently studying Cyber Security.
            I'm buidling this website and making use of Github's awesome hosting service to host all files that are required
            in my app's Graphical User Interface. Some examples of files that can be found here:
        </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <strong>
            <li>Wheel Files for few Python libraries.</li>
            <li>Photos used in the GUI.</li>
            <li>GUI's icon.</li>
            <li>Finally. Our product itself as an installer.</li>
            </strong>
        </ul>
        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; background-color: #efefef;">What is my project?</h1>
        <p><strong>I was given this project by employers from RTVA (Radio and Television of Amstelveen) in Amsterdam.
            We luckily get to choose the project that we want to work on. The team and I decided to go for second project
            from a total of five. For this one we need to build a program that would control our live stream, switching
            between cameras based on audio-input going through the mics. Project is done but I'll keep running this service
            and work on optimizing my code. There's no real reason why other than I liked working on this project and want
            to make it work as good as possible.
